# surveyForm
It is a self hosted website for creating and answering surveys.
## Installation
For installing you need to have docker and docker compose installed, both come with docker desktop. 
Then you just run:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
## Usage
To access the server just go to localhost:5000, if you want access from other places you can port forward. I would recomend using twingate, for accessing it outside your local network for its security and because it is mostly selfhosted.
